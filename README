Moonlight Productions :: Blues Brothers RPG

Finally we have reached a release of Blues Brothers RPG! It's been made for the
Chione Challenge, the RPGDX Winter 2003 competition with lots of snow.

The story begins when Elwood is released from prison. His brother Jake tells
him about their third brother, Brian, who was adopted by their mother even
before they were born. The game starts when Elwood and Jake make plans to safe
their third brother who is still held in prison.

Have fun playing our game, we had great fun in making it!

The Moonlight RPG engine
------------------------

This RPG uses the Moonlight RPG engine, which is licensed under GPL. Its
current specifications are:

- Allegro for graphics, keyboard input, timers and sample playback
- alogg for OGG file playback
- Using the Lua extension language for the scripting
- Using object oriented, flexible tile engine
- Comes with its own map/tile editor
- Allows use of multiple tile bitmaps per map, and the other way around

All the game content is released as GPL too. Feel free to use it in your own
game as long as you GPL anything you add to it as well.


-------------------
Config file options
-------------------

In RPG.cfg you can specify if you want to run the RPG fullscreen or windowed.
You can also enable vsync there (might look smoother for some users). Further 
more, if you are running in windowed mode, you might want to enable the double 
size feature. You can also use this with the fullscreen mode if your videocard 
doesn't support 320x240 high/truecolor modes.

If the game runs choppy, try reducing the colordepth to 16 or 15 bit.

The sound section in the config file allows you to specify the volume of music
and sound effects seperately, or turn either off completely.
